Instructions regarding code:

I have submitted a .py and a .ipynb file of the same code. The .py file can be run using the 'python3 gnss_analysis.py' command. The jupyter notebook can be launched and run directly.

The code contains 3 parts, all of them essentially the same but each part performs the relevant tasks like analysing and plotting for each of the log files. 

Towards the start of the code, just after library linking, there are 3 instructions to open files into file pointers f1, f2, f3. These 3 files are the inside, partially outside and outside log files respectively. By changing the names of the files here, different log files can be analysed by the code.

Students I discussed my Homework with:

M Harini Saraswathy
Roshini Karedla
Archana Kutumbaka
